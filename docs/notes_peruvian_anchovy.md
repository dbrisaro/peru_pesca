# Hydrodynamics and Ecology of the NHCS

## Hydrodynamics Studies

Modeling studies have been conducted to understand the hydrodynamics of the NHCS (Penven et al. 2005; Colas et al. 2012), its interannual variability (Colas et al. 2008; Espinoza-Morriberón et al. 2017), its potential changes under future climate scenarios (Oerder et al. 2015; Echevin et al. 2020), and the seasonal cycle and intraseasonal variability of surface chlorophyll (Echevin et al. 2008, 2014).

## Peruvian Anchovy (Engraulis ringens)

In the NHCS, the Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens) is a highly prolific species (~15,000 eggs/batch) that reaches its sexual maturity at the age of one year. The anchovy spawns mainly in the coastal zone close to the surface (Gutiérrez et al. 2007, 2008). Early life stages take advantage of the exceptional continental shelf nursery area thanks to the high productivity from the upwelling zone, which contributes to making E. ringens the most abundant species, supporting the world's largest mono-specific fishery (Fréon et al. 2003; Alheit and Niquen 2004; Gutiérrez et al. 2016; Checkley et al. 2017; FAO 2020). E. ringens fishery is managed based on scientific monitoring of population indicators (Ayón 2000; Gutiérrez et al. 2007), but the link between environmental variability and anchovy recruitment, and thereby biomass of the adult population, is still unclear.

## Ecosystem Modeling

Ecosystem modeling studies have been conducted to understand the dynamics of the NHCS ecosystem and the role of the anchovy in this ecosystem (Shin et al. 2008; Shannon et al. 2014). These studies have shown that the anchovy plays a key role in the ecosystem, as it is a key prey for many predators, including seabirds, marine mammals, and other fish species.

## Anchovy Recruitment

Anchovy recruitment is a key parameter for the management of the fishery. It is influenced by environmental factors, such as sea surface temperature, upwelling intensity, and the presence of predators. Several studies have shown that anchovy recruitment is correlated with sea surface temperature (Gutiérrez et al. 2007, 2016; Bertrand et al. 2008; Espinoza-Morriberón et al. 2017) and that the presence of predators can reduce anchovy recruitment (Gutiérrez et al. 2008).

## Anchovy Larval Transport

The transport of anchovy larvae in the NHCS is influenced by the oceanic circulation, which is driven by the wind and the coastal upwelling. The larvae are advected offshore by the coastal upwelling and then transported northward by the Peru Current. The larvae are also influenced by the mesoscale eddies that are present in the NHCS (Colas et al. 2012). The larvae are transported to the north of the NHCS, where they settle and recruit

## Growth Rate Experiments

Current experiments found the fastest growth at 19°C for larval stages but did not investigate higher temperature values (Rioual et al. 2021). Some preliminary results tend to indicate for juvenile stages a reduction of ingestion rate from 21ºC (unpublished data), which would impact the growth rate.
